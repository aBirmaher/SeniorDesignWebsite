    <h2 class="hidden">OVERVIEW</h2>
    <p class="text_column">Welcome to Group 7’s Solar Powered Wi-Fi Umbrella. I bet the first question asked is how does this project function? And the best way to answer that question is to look at the name of the project and break it down. <br><br>First, we have the “Solar Powered” part of the name. As the name suggest this project is powered using the sun and for this project the way it will be powered is with 4 monocrystalline solar panels that are connected to a PV controller that was constructed by the group in the form of a PCB. This controller is meant to power up the backup battery power source that will power the connected various devices such as the Wi-Fi amplifier and lights. As for the exact process in which the solar panels will charge the battery is straightforward in that the solar panels absorb the sun rays and they convert that into power that will then be directed towards the PV controller. This controller is configured such that it notices when the battery falls below a certain voltage threshold and when the battery reaches above a certain threshold. This is needed to make sure that the battery maintains enough voltage to power up any devices during the night or days where the sun is not friendly. </p>
    <p class="text_column">The next part of the name of the project is “Wi-Fi” and the reason why an umbrella will have Wi-Fi capabilities is because it is the year 2017 and as each day goes by more and more components require a form of internet connection to work at full potential and that is why the inclusion of a Wi-Fi capabilities was added to the project. The version of Wi-Fi feature included in the project was not to become its own source of internet but instead to take an already existing network and amplify its signal coverage. The reasoning for this is because this project is not meant to be used inside a house or building but instead outside where Wi-Fi signal is very weak or after a certain distance the signal becomes non-existing. However, if this product is placed in a location where the signal is weak the amplifier chosen will can amplify the signal over a large distance.<br><br>The last part of the name of the project is the “Umbrella”. The reasoning for this is because the members of Group 7 want to enjoy the great outdoors while also being able to use the technology brought upon in the 21st century. Plus, the state of Florida can get very hot and sunny during the summer days and this project will provide some great shade. However, the project will not just consist of a simple umbrella but instead  </p>
    <p class="text_column">a more complex umbrella that possesses different capabilities. The first feature are the LED lights. Their inclusion to the umbrella had two functions other than aesthetic reasons and they are to illuminate an area in the instance the umbrella is used at night while the other feature that because an emergency sequence was integrated in the umbrella and the lights can function as a form of alarm by flashing on or off in a sequence after the pressing of a button. The other feature that was embedded in the umbrella was an emergency button. This button when pressed will send a message to a designated recipient and mention the time and location in which the button was pressed. As mentioned previously, the lights also have an emergency feature that when a button is pressed they will flash in an alternating pattern and this is the button in which the lights will do this pattern (when properly configured). <br><br>There you have it. Group 7’s Solar Powered Wi-Fi Umbrella broken down by name, features, and functions. Group 7 hopes that you enjoyed reading our project and if you are interested in reading or learning more about the project or its group members that is what this website is for. Enjoy the rest of your day and Charge On! </p>
